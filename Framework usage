This file explains roughly how to edit the framework's code in order to implement a project with it.
There are code examples left commented out in the code, use them if needed and remember to remove what is not needed.
Almost everywhere where editing is required, a TODO with explanation is found.

1) Edit the args file to support all the required arguments for your project. This script is for convenience and can be
altered later as well according to your needs.

2) In the setup.py script:
 a) Edit the download function to download the files needed - word vectors for example.
 b) Edit the main part (bottom) and add to args anything required for the preprocess of your data.
 b) Edit the pre_process - add preprocessing code for your data.

3) Edit the environment.yml file according to your project needs.

4) Edit the util.py file:
 a) add your utility functions and classes.
 b) add a Dataset class that handles the example retreival.

5) In test.py file:
 a) update the dataset usage to use the dataset class from the utils file.
